# Machine Learning Notes
Technical notes I keep while learning about machine learning.

You will need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.4 or later), and then jupyter notebooks.

Each notebook uses a collection of external packages, install whatever you need accordingly.
